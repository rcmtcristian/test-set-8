        about me

      <p>
        It was 7:45 pm on a Friday night. Truthfully I got home from work at 7:30. I was just sitting there for 15 minutes, staring at the kitchen light shine through the window on this dark evening and feeling the sense of dread that radiated from that house, Her house. My wife Megan was an amazing girlfriend. cool, laidback, sexy. The kind of girl to throw back beers with you at the tailgate. Everything I ever wanted, but everything I never got. From the second I married her ungrateful ass it’s been nagging, jealous, insecure, dead bedroom, and no going out with my friends unless I want to be in the dog house. I looked at the house that I once considered mine, and as I watched the lace curtains in the window I felt my blood boil with resentment knowing that it’s now her house.

        I took a deep breath and stepped out of the car. I instinctively reached for my pocket to check my phone, and I remembered why I had been waiting in the car so long. I left my phone at home that day, with Meg. There was no way she didn’t read through my texts, or emails, or browser history. Hell she probably looked through my Amazon purchases. She never trusted me for shit. I sighed and walked to the door, while my mind was screaming at my body to drive away and never come back. I hesitantly turned the door knob and opened the door to my wife’s house.

      <p>As I opened the door and a gust of the scent of my favorite meal wafted into my face, a beef roast in the slow cooker. Meg hasn’t made this since the time she told me she dented my car. I was immediately suspicious. “Hi honey welcome home.” I hear her sickly sweet voice call me from the kitchen.</p>
